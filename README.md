# EchoMind: A Window to Mental Health

### For my DL Lab, I have created this Project along with my teammates.
### Depression ranks among the major causes of disability globally, making it one of the most urgent public health issues. Due to its extensive repercussions, which include decreased social functioning and suicidal thoughts, early and correct detection is critically needed.
### We have created a DL model that helps to detect depression by using the answers to the questions a user inputs.
